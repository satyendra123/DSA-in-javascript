🟢 PART 1: Two Lists (Arrays) – Beginner

Assume:

let names = ["ram", "shyam", "mohan"];
let marks = [45, 78, 62];

Create an object like { ram: 45, shyam: 78, mohan: 62 }

Print the name of the student who scored the highest marks

Print the name of the student who scored the lowest marks

Print all students who scored more than 60

Find the average marks

Sort students by marks (ascending)

Sort students by marks (descending)

Print output like:

ram scored 45
shyam scored 78
mohan scored 62

Count how many students passed (marks ≥ 50)

Create a new array of only marks greater than 50

🟡 PART 2: Two Lists – Tricky Logic

Assume:

let l1 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
let l2 = [10, 20, 30, 40];

Create an object using a loop

Find the sum of all values

Remove the key "c" from the object

Increase every value by 5

Convert the object back to two arrays

Swap keys and values → {10:"a",20:"b",...}

Find the key whose value is 30

Check if value 25 exists

Create a new object with only even values

Multiply all values by 2

🔵 PART 3: Two Dictionaries (Objects) – Beginner

Assume:

let d1 = { a: 10, b: 20, c: 30 };
let d2 = { b: 5, c: 15, d: 25 };

Find common keys

Find keys present only in d1

Find keys present only in d2

Merge both objects

For common keys, add their values
Output: { a:10, b:25, c:45, d:25 }

Find the total sum of all values

Count total number of keys

Find the key with maximum value

Find the key with minimum value

Convert object to array of [key, value]

🟠 PART 4: Two Dictionaries – Tricky / Interview Level

Using same d1 and d2:

Create intersection object (only common keys with summed values)

Create union object (all keys, sum if common)

Create difference object (d1 - d2)

Create symmetric difference object

Sort object by values

Check if both objects are equal

Find duplicate values across both objects

Multiply values of d1 by corresponding values of d2 (common keys only)

Create an array of keys whose value > 20

Remove keys whose value < 15

🔴 PART 5: Very Tricky (Think Like a Developer)

Merge two objects without using Object.assign()

Deep copy an object manually

Count frequency of values in an object

Reverse an object (keys ↔ values)

Convert object into sorted array and back to object

Find the second highest value

Group keys by even and odd values

Find missing keys between two objects

Update object values using another object as reference

Validate if an object has duplicate values

🧠 BONUS CHALLENGES (🔥 Real Confidence Builders)

Solve without using Object.keys()

Solve using only for...in

Solve using only for loop

Solve using reduce()

Solve using map + filter
